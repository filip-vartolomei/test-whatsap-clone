# My dear code reviewer 👋

## Please read me

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

So in order to make this app work on your local machine, it should be pretty much straightfoward.

### Step 1

install all the dependecies with
`npm i` or `yarn i`

### Step 2

run: `npm start`

Will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# My thoughts after completing this test

I know that at the current position I am applying for, you are using **MobX**.

> So I took a look to see what it is about and I kind of **fall in ❤️ with it**, and decide to use it in the test.

Really liked the way it make almost magic beind when you play with the states.

Please don't be harsh on judging the way I have used it, because I don't know yet the best patterns/practices.

Some stuff didn't work in one case like: `computed` but if we were colleagues, I would asked for help defenitelly.

For the UI, I know is messy, it's because I have used Tailwind, that's because I have found some parts online and have used it.

> I really hope the code is readable and easy to debug.

Cheers.
